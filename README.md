## 💡 The idea

Most "AI trading" bots predict direction and bet on it — a coin flip in a nice costume.
And naïve hedging *loses* money: protection costs premium, so in a calm week an insurance
bot just bleeds. **We solve both** by treating options as a risk overlay, not a wager, on
top of an appreciating core book of liquid ETFs + mega-caps.

Three engines drive the P&L, each with its downside capped by design:

```mermaid

    subgraph P["Three profit engines · each loss-capped"]

        E1["📈 <b>Core book drift</b><br/>diversified ETFs + mega-caps<br/>carry the baseline return"]

## 🏗️ System architecture

A clean split: **deterministic Python owns the math**, the **model owns the judgment**, and
a **fail-closed executor** owns the orders. Nothing crosses those lines.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

        A1["Alpaca paper feed"]
        A2["Mock feed / fixtures<br/><i>runs fully offline</i>"]

```

**The model never does arithmetic and never invents an order.** It picks exactly one of a
set of pre-vetted, pre-sized candidates. Numbers measure; the model judges; the log remembers.

---

## 🔄 The decision loop

Every cycle the agent runs one loop — and the split between the two owners is the whole point.

| Deterministic code owns — **the math** | The model owns — **the judgment** |
|---|---|
| Exposure, volatility, VaR, stress tests | *When* risk is worth hedging **right now** |
| How many contracts for a given coverage | *How much* to protect, given cost + regime |
| Whether protection is cheap today | *When* to release a hedge no longer needed |
| All order sizing and hard risk caps | Reading soft context the numbers miss, and explaining the move |

---

## 🔌 Per-cycle protocol (model ↔ deterministic core)

The harness exposes the model **exactly two tools** and forces their order. Order sizing,
strikes, and risk caps are computed deterministically and hidden behind the gate — the model
only ever *chooses*.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant HB as ⏰ Heartbeat
    participant A as 🔀 Model-native adapter
    participant M as 🤖 Reasoning model

    HB->>A: wake (interval · market hours)

    X-->>L: fills / intents
    B->>L: decision + reason → self-grade
```

## 📊 What it measures

A compact risk snapshot every cycle — dozens of institutional-grade measures, all pure
functions, all unit-tested, all dependency-free:

```mermaid
mindmap
  root(("🧮 Risk<br/>Engine"))
    Exposure
      Beta-weighted delta
      OLS beta
      Downside beta
      Min-variance hedge ratio
    Volatility & VaR
      EWMA vol · λ=0.94
      Parametric VaR 95/99
      Historical VaR
    Tail risk
      Expected Shortfall · CVaR
      Cornish–Fisher VaR
      Skew & excess kurtosis
    Premium signals
      IV Rank
      Variance Risk Premium
      Put skew
    Pricing · Black–Scholes
      Price · Δ · Θ · Γ · Vega
      Strike-for-delta
    Liquidity gates
      Relative spread
      Two-sided quote check
```

Those signals roll into a single **Risk Score (0–100)** that drives the hedge. The mapping is
an exact, transparent function — **calm ⇒ near-zero hedge (no drag); stress ⇒ step protection up:**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Risk Score → target hedge coverage"
    x-axis "Risk Score (0–100)" [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]
    y-axis "Target coverage (%)" 0 --> 100
    line [0, 0, 50, 100, 100]
```

And the **inverse dial** governs premium selling — harvest hardest when options are richest
versus realized volatility (positive variance risk premium), damped to zero as the regime turns:

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Variance risk premium → income aggressiveness (calm regime)"
    x-axis "VRP (vol points)" [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    y-axis "Aggressiveness (%)" 0 --> 100
    line [0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 100]
```

---

## 🎛️ Strategy postures

The two dials combine into one of four stances each cycle. The agent moves between them
automatically as regime and premium richness change:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> SIT
    SIT: 😌 SIT<br/>cheap IV · calm<br/>nothing to sell, nothing to fear
    HARVEST: 🪙 HARVEST<br/>rich IV · calm<br/>sell premium, minimal hedge
    HARVEST_HEDGE: ⚖️ HARVEST + HEDGE<br/>rich IV · rising risk
    DEFEND: 🛡️ DEFEND<br/>risk-off<br/>hedge steps in, income stands down

    SIT --> HARVEST: VRP turns rich
    HARVEST --> HARVEST_HEDGE: risk rising
    HARVEST --> DEFEND: regime risk-off
    SIT --> DEFEND: regime risk-off
    HARVEST_HEDGE --> DEFEND: stress deepens
    DEFEND --> HARVEST: risk clears
    HARVEST_HEDGE --> HARVEST: risk clears
    DEFEND --> SIT: calm & cheap IV
```

---

## 🛡️ How the hedge reshapes P&L

The point of the overlay: **cap the left tail while keeping the upside.** Below is the payoff
mechanism of the protective overlay — book alone vs. book + hedge across an adverse move.
*(Illustrative of the protective-put mechanism, not a historical return series.)*

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Book P&L vs. underlying move — unhedged (bleeds) vs. hedged (floored)"
    x-axis "Underlying move (%)" [-15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10]
    y-axis "Book P&L ($k)" -16 --> 12
    line [-15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10]
    line [-6, -6, -5, -1, 4, 9]
```

> The lower line is the naked book — a straight loss into a sell-off. The upper line is
> book + hedge: the left tail flattens (the put pays), the small gap at 0% is the financed
> premium, and the upside is preserved. **Defense you can watch, not a backtest you must trust.**

We also **replay the engine through real historical crashes** (`backtest/`) — showing the
unhedged vs. hedged equity curves so the cushion is visible over more than five live days.

---

## 🧺 The core book

Fixed **upfront** — the agent *protects* the book, it never picks it. Diversified across
market, size, and sector so no single name dominates the P&L, yet every holding stays highly
correlated to SPY so the **SPY put hedge actually covers the book** (low basis risk). ~80%
invested; the rest is a cash sleeve for premium + margin.

```mermaid
pie showData
    title Core book — target weights (% of equity)
    "SPY" : 24
    "Cash" : 20
    "QQQ" : 11
    "IWM" : 10
    "DIA" : 9
    "XLV" : 8
    "XLF" : 7
    "XLE" : 4
    "NVDA" : 3
    "AAPL" : 2
    "MSFT" : 2
```

Weights (not hard-coded share counts) are the single source of truth, so the same definition
sizes correctly at any account value or price — see [`risk_engine/book.py`](risk_engine/book.py).

---

## 🚦 Hard risk caps (the model cannot override these)

Every downside is bounded by a deterministic gate that runs *after* the model decides.
Offending income is **scaled down, never silently dropped**, so the model only ever chooses
from a pre-validated, safe set — see [`risk_engine/limits.py`](risk_engine/limits.py).

| Guardrail | Cap | Behaviour when breached |
|---|---|---|
| 🩸 **Daily-loss halt** | −5% on the day | Stop opening new premium (keep the hedge on) |
| 📦 **Total option risk** | ≤ 30% of equity | Scale income down to fit |
| 🎯 **Per-underlying risk** | ≤ 15% of equity | Scale the offending symbol down |
| 🛡️ **Hedge premium / cycle** | ≤ 5% of equity | Flag (never auto-reduce protection) |

---

## 🤖 Model selection & qualification

The reasoning brain sits behind a single config seam so we can swap open models freely. We
don't take a vendor's word for it — every candidate runs a **30-call transport qualification**
(10 direct + 20 through the DSH harness) with a strict, forced two-tool schema. A candidate
that emits malformed tool calls, drifts schema, or times out is **disqualified**.

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Transport qualification — successful tool calls (of 30)"
    x-axis ["GLM-5.3", "DSV4-Pro", "DSV4-Flash"]
    y-axis "Calls passed" 0 --> 30
    bar [30, 18, 25]
```

| Candidate | Verdict | Direct (10) | DSH (20) | Schema-invalid | Timeouts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **GLM-5.3** | ✅ **Passed** | 10/10 | 20/20 | 0 | 0 |
| DSV4-Pro | ❌ Failed | 0/10 | 18/20 | 12 | 0 |
| DSV4-Flash | ❌ Failed | 9/10 | 16/20 | 5 | 0 |

Only **GLM-5.3** is transport-stable across all 30 calls; both DeepSeek candidates fail on
native schema instability (not parse/timeout artifacts). Evidence is committed under
[`results/`](results/). The model-native adapter normalizes each provider's dialect (standard
tool-calls, GLM XML, DeepSeek DSML) back to one canonical call — no prompt demonstrations,
temperature 0, harness-owned decision ids.

## ☁️ Deployment: always-on heartbeat

Packaged as a durable **Modal** app — an always-on CPU container that owns the heartbeat and
exposes an HTTP liveness probe. **Paper-safe by construction: no Alpaca credential is mounted,
so this deployment physically cannot place a trade** until a separate, reviewed change arms it.

## ▶️ Run it

```bash
# 1. Seed the core book on the Alpaca paper account (dry-run first)
python scripts/seed_book.py            # show the plan
python scripts/seed_book.py --execute  # place the paper buy orders

# 2. Take one live decision cycle — read the book + market, size the posture
python -m agent.cli context --live
```

Run the always-on monitoring heartbeat through DSH (interval-driven, market-hours gated):

```bash
dsh --profile portfolio-agent --live --heartbeat "protect the book"
```

Credentials come from `.env` (`ALPACA_API_KEY` / `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`, paper). **The whole
stack runs offline against a mock feed when no keys are set** — no account needed to develop.

---

## ✅ Testing

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests        # 74 Python tests
cd agent/dsh && npm test                    # 20 DSH / adapter tests
```

**94 tests, zero external services required.** The deterministic core is exercised end-to-end
— metrics, pricing, scoring, sizing, caps, the candidate gate, the model-native adapter, and
the paper-placement path — all offline.

---
